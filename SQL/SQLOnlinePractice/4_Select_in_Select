-- Using Nested Select

-- Illustration
-- 1. List each country in the same continent as 'Brazil'.
SELECT name FROM world WHERE continent = (SELECT continent FROM world WHERE name = 'Brazil')

-- 2. List each country and its continent in the same continent as 'Brazil' or 'Mexico'.
SELECT name, continent FROM world WHERE continent IN (SELECT continent FROM world WHERE name='Brazil' OR name='Mexico')

-- 3. Show the population of China as a multiple of the population of the United Kingdom
SELECT population/(SELECT population FROM world
             WHERE name='United Kingdom')
  FROM world
WHERE name = 'China'

-- 4. Show each country that has a population greater than the population of ALL countries in Europe.
SELECT name FROM world
 WHERE population > ALL
      (SELECT population FROM world
        WHERE continent='Europe')

-- Question
-- 1. List each country name where the population is larger than that of 'Russia'.
SELECT name FROM world WHERE population > (SELECT population FROM world WHERE name='Russia')

-- 2. Show the countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than 'United Kingdom'.
SELECT name FROM world WHERE continent='Europe'
AND (gdp/population) > (SELECT (gdp/population)
FROM world WHERE name='United Kingdom')

-- 3. List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing either Argentina or Australia.
-- Order by name of the country.
SELECT name, continent FROM world
WHERE continent = (SELECT continent FROM world WHERE name='Argentina') OR
continent = (SELECT continent FROM world WHERE name='Australia')
ORDER BY name

-- 4. Which country has a population that is more than Canada but less than Poland?
-- Show the name and the population.
SELECT name, population FROM world WHERE population>(SELECT population FROM world WHERE name='Canada') AND population<(SELECT population FROM world WHERE name='Poland')

-- 5. Show the name and the population of each country in Europe. Show the population as a percentage of the population of Germany.
SELECT name, CONCAT(ROUND(population/(SELECT population FROM world WHERE name ='Germany')*100, 0), '%') FROM world WHERE continent = 'Europe'

-- 6. Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.]
-- (Some countries may have NULL gdp values)
SELECT name FROM world WHERE gdp > ALL(SELECT gdp FROM world WHERE continent='Europe' and gdp>0)

-- 7. Find the largest country (by population) in each continent,
    SELECT continent, name, population FROM world w1
      WHERE population >= ALL
        (SELECT population FROM world w2
            WHERE w2.continent=w1.continent
              AND population>0)
-- Find the largest country (by area) in each continent,
        SELECT continent, name, area FROM world x
          WHERE area >= ALL
            (SELECT area FROM world y
                WHERE y.continent=x.continent
                  AND area>0)

-- 8. List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically.
SELECT continent, name FROM world x WHERE name <= ALL(SELECT name FROM world y WHERE x.continent = y.continent)

-- 9. Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find
-- the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population.
SELECT name, continent, population FROM world WHERE continent IN
(SELECT continent FROM world x WHERE (SELECT MAX(population) FROM world y WHERE x.continent = y.continent) <= 25000000)

SELECT name, continent, population FROM world WHERE continent IN
(SELECT continent FROM world x WHERE 25000000 >= ALL(SELECT population FROM world y WHERE x.continent = y.continent))

-- 10. Some countries have populations more than three times
-- that of any of their neighbours (in the same continent). Give the countries and continents.
SELECT name, continent FROM world WHERE name IN (SELECT name FROM world x WHERE population >= (SELECT MAX(population) FROM world y WHERE y.name <>x.name AND x.continent = y.continent)*3) ORDER BY name;

SELECT name, continent FROM world x
  WHERE population > ALL(SELECT 3*population FROM world y WHERE x.continent = y.continent AND x.name <> y.name)
